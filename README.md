# Fantasy Frogs: Guardians of the Pond
prototype build: https://towerdefenceg.github.io/WaspVFrog/v0.1/index.html

This is a tower defence game where the frogs must defend their village from the wasps.

Place frog towers by selecting a frog type from the shop on the right and then clicking a tile in the grid to place the frog.
The yellow frogs have a shorter range but faster firing speed while the orange frogs have a larger range but slower speed.

Money is gained by killing wasps (currently blue spheres) and spent by buying more towers

Waves will keep spawning indefinitely until all lives are lost, showing the game over screen (buttons currently non-functional).
